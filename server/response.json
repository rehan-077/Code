    "summary":"Vue.js is a JavaScript framework designed for creating user interfaces. It prioritizes simplicity, allowing users to progressively incorporate features and tools for building complex web applications. Vue.js enables the creation of components with encapsulated data, which are reactively linked to HTML templates. Changes to the data \"trigger automatic re-rendering\" of the view. Vue.js offers HTML-based template syntax, interpolation using double braces, and directives for controlling HTML behavior based on data. Conditional rendering is possible with 'v-if'.",
